🏠 House Price Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on predicting house prices using various machine learning techniques. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, outlier removal, encoding, scaling, and model training using popular regression algorithms.

📊 Dataset Information
The dataset used is related to housing features and prices, with both categorical and numerical variables that influence the market value of houses.

🧠 Problem Statement
To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices based on the given input features.

🛠 Features of the Notebook
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering: Creating new relevant features and transforming existing ones.

Encoding: Applying suitable encoding for categorical variables.

Outlier Detection and Removal: Identifying and removing anomalous data points.

Data Scaling: Normalizing data for better model performance.

Model Training: Using models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Model Evaluation: Performance assessment using metrics such as R² and RMSE.

Model Exporting: Final model is serialized using pickle for deployment.
